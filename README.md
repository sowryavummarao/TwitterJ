# TwitterJ
Sowrya's personal twitter project

This is a Twitter helper that works on the command line. Uses Twitter4J (Java library for Twitter API). 
Users can tweet a status straight from the command line, use an autotweeting option that will tweet at a specified time. 

Users can also save tweet ideas into a database, and tweet/autotweet straight from this database. 

Application uses OAuth so that users don't have to manually sign in.
